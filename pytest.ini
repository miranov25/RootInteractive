markers =
    feature(name): Feature ID from FEATURE_TAXONOMY

    p0: Priority 0 - critical/blocking
    p1: Priority 1 - important/required
    p2: Priority 2 - nice to have
    cross_backend: Test requires both Python and JavaScript execution
    slow: Mark test as slow-running
    regression(pr): Regression test for a specific PR
    gui: Test creates GUI/visualization
    unittest: Unit test marker (legacy)
